## üîí Security Considerations

### Current Security Features
- **Custom Service UUIDs**: Uses unique identifiers instead of standard Nordic UART service
- **Just Works Pairing**: Simple, secure connection establishment
- **Connection Logging**: Tracks client device addresses for monitoring
- **MTU Negotiation**: Negotiates optimal packet sizes securely

### Security Limitations
- **No Encryption**: Messages are sent in plain text (consider adding encryption for sensitive data)
- **No Authentication**: Any BLE-capable device can attempt connection
- **Broadcast Discovery**: Service UUIDs are visible during device scanning
- **Single Connection**: Only one device can connect at a time

### Privacy Protection
- **Device Address Logging**: Connected device addresses are logged for monitoring
- **Connection Filtering**: Future updates can add device whitelisting
- **Custom UUIDs**: Makes device discovery less obvious to generic BLE scanners

**Security Level**: Development/Demo (not production-ready)

### Next Steps for Production Deployment:
- **Phase 1**: Implement BLE bonding and encryption
- **Phase 2**: Add device authentication and pairing management  
- **Phase 3**: Multi-device support with secure device registry
- **Phase 4**: Connection attempt monitoring and security logging

## üîó Communication Protocol

The devices communicate via **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** using JSON messages with **MTU negotiation** for larger payloads:

### Device to Phone Messages (ESP32 ‚Üí App)
```json
{
  "type": "btn",
  "message": "Ask AI",
  "action": "ask"
}
```

### Phone to Device Messages (App ‚Üí ESP32)
```json
{
  "type": "test",
  "message": "Hello from React Native app!",
  "action": "test_message"
}
```

## üéÆ User Interaction Flow

1. **Connection**: Phone app automatically scans and connects to ESP32 device via BLE
2. **Device Interaction**: User presses "Ask AI" button on ESP32 touch interface
3. **Message Transmission**: Device sends button press data to phone app
4. **AI Response**: Phone generates contextual AI response

## Original Requirements

Touch Interface Communication Device
Design and implement a physical touch device (using Arduino/ESP32 or similar microcontroller with a small display) that communicates with a mobile application.

Requirements:
The device should have a screen that can display surface messages (e.g., short AI assistant prompts, notifications, or mock responses).

A touch interface (touchscreen or buttons) should allow the user to send actions/acknowledgments back.

A phone app (mobile or desktop mock) should:

Send mock data/messages to the device.

Receive interactions/taps from the device.
Show "expended view" of selected interactions
You don't need to implement a real AI backend ‚Äî focus on communication flow and user experience. A demo of a few interactions is enough.
